# RSS Feed for TR
Under Developement. Help Appreciated.

## Objectives
RSS feeds of torrent websites are ususally used for automation of downloading torrent files. For eg. I use [EZTV RSS](http://eztv.ag/ezrss.xml) to automate my downloads through qBittorent for various TV Series I watch.

This repo will provide a RSS feed for TR so as to help the people(like me) to automate their process.

The RSS standard for bittorent protocol is [BEP 36](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0036.html).

## Req skills for contribution:
* Python >3.5
* Web-scraping (BS4)
* RSS Schema (Atom and [BEP-36](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0036.html))
